        <p>Shah Rukh Khan (pronounced [ˈʃɑːɦɾʊx xɑːn] ⓘ; born 2 November 1965), also known by the initialism SRK, is a
            Indian actor and film producer who works in Hindi films. Referred to in the media as the "Baadshah of
            Bollywood" and "King Khan",[a] he has appeared in more than 100 films, and earned numerous accolades,
            including 14 Filmfare Awards.
        <p> He has been awarded the Padma Shri by the Government of India, as well as Ordre des Arts et des Lettres and
            Legion of Honour by the Government of France. Khan has a significant
            following in Asia and the Indian diaspora worldwide. In terms of audience size and income, several media
            outlets have described him as one of the most successful film stars in the world.[b] Many of his films
            thematise Indian national identity and connections with diaspora communities, or gender, racial, social and
            religious differences and grievances.

            Khan began his career with appearances in several television series in the late 1980s and made his Bollywood
            debut in 1992 with the musical romance Deewana. He was initially recognised for playing villainous roles in
            the films Baazigar (1993) and Darr (1993). Khan established himself by starring in a series of top-grossing
            romantic films, including Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge (1995), Dil To Pagal Hai (1997), Kuch Kuch Hota Hai
            (1998), Mohabbatein (2000), Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham... (2001), Kal Ho Naa Ho (2003), Veer-Zaara (2004) and
            Kabhi Alvida Naa Kehna (2006). He earned critical acclaim for his portrayal of an alcoholic in the period
            romantic drama Devdas (2002), a NASA scientist in the social drama Swades (2004), a hockey coach in the
            sports drama Chak De! India (2007), and a man with Asperger syndrome in the drama My Name Is Khan (2010).
            Further commercial successes came with the romances Om Shanti Om (2007) and Rab Ne Bana Di Jodi (2008), and
            with his expansion to comedies in Chennai Express (2013) and Happy New Year (2014). Following a brief
            setback and hiatus, Khan made a career comeback with the 2023 action thrillers Pathaan and Jawan, both of
            which rank among the highest-grossing Indian films.</p>

        Zain Javadd Malik (/ˈmælɪk/ MAL-ik; born 12 January 1993), known professionally as Zayn Malik or simply Zayn, is
        a British singer. Malik auditioned as a solo contestant for the British music competition television series The
        X Factor in 2010. After being eliminated, he was brought back to the competition to form the five-piece boy band
        One Direction, which went on to become one of the best-selling boy bands of all time. He left the group in March
        2015 and signed a solo recording contract with RCA Records.

        Adopting a more alternative R&B music style on his first solo studio album, Mind of Mine (2016), and its lead
        single, "Pillowtalk", he became the first British male artist to debut at number one in both the UK and US with
        his debut single and album. His subsequent collaborative singles "I Don't Wanna Live Forever" with Taylor Swift
        and "Dusk Till Dawn" featuring Sia were met with international success. He released his second studio album,
        Icarus Falls, in 2018, followed by his third album, Nobody Is Listening, in 2021.</p>
